# Level 15 - Level 16: Bandit - OverTheWire

## Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

## Solution



```bash
bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign_eof
...
...
...
---
read R BLOCK
