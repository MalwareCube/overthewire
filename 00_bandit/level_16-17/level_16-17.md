# Level 16 - Level 17: Bandit - OverTheWire

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Solution



```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap 127.0.0.1 -p 31000-32000
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-31 03:21 UTC
