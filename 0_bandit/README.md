Link to Bandit: [https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. In this directory, I include writeups as well as the scripts I wrote to solve each level.
