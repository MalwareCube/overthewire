# Level 25 - Level 26: Bandit - OverTheWire

## Level Goal

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

## Solution


```bash
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell
```

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit27-do id
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
